#                         the two codes identically. So, as an implementor, 
#                         unless your  keyboard generates both of those codes  
#                         and your OS treats them differently, you should  
#                         generate SDL_SCANCODE_BACKSLASH instead of this 
#                         code. As a user, you should not rely on this code  
#                         becauseSDL will never generate it with most (all?) 
#                         keyboards.
